# ðŸŽ¯ Why a 500 Error is a Bug Hunter's Signal

A **500 Internal Server Error** can be a goldmine for bug bounty hunters and penetration testers. It often indicates a server struggling with unexpected input, pointing you directly to a parameter worth investigating.

An HTTP 500 Internal Server Error is a generic "catch-all" response that indicates the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. Unlike a 404 (Not Found) or a 403 (Forbidden), a 500 error often suggests that your input reached a backend processing function that then crashed â€” making it a prime indicator for potential vulnerabilities.

Common triggers include missing or malformed parameters, type mismatches (e.g., passing a string where an integer is expected), or improper server configuration. These unhandled exceptions can be symptoms of deeper issues like insecure deserialization or SQL injection.

## ðŸ”Ž Discovering Parameters with Fuzzing

The first step is to find which parameters cause the server to react. Use tools like `ffuf` or `gobuster` to brute-force parameter names.

**Example using `ffuf`:**
```bash
ffuf -w /path/to/parameter_wordlist.txt -u "https://target.com/endpoint?FUZZ=test" -mc all -ac
```

**Example using `gobuster fuzz`:**
```bash
gobuster fuzz -u "https://target.com/endpoint?FUZZ=test" -w /path/to/parameter_wordlist.txt
```

In these commands, the `FUZZ` keyword is replaced by words from your wordlist. The `-mc all` option in `ffuf` tells it to match all HTTP status codes, and `-ac` enables auto-calibration to filter out common false positives.

A well-chosen wordlist is crucial. Start with common parameter names like `id`, `user`, `file`, `data`, `token`, `callback`, `url`, etc.

## ðŸš€ Fuzzing Promising Parameters

Once you identify a parameter that triggers a 500 error, fuzz it with a wide range of payloads to understand its vulnerability.

**Refined `ffuf` command for fuzzing values:**
```bash
ffuf -w /path/to/payload_wordlist.txt -u "https://target.com/endpoint?VULNERABLE_PARAM=FUZZ" -mr "error|exception" -ac -mc 200,500
```

- `-w` specifies your payload wordlist.  
- `-mr` allows matching on specific text in the response (like error messages), useful even if status codes change.  
- `-mc 200,500` shows responses with either a `200` or `500` status.

### âœ… What to Look For
- **Different error messages:** Changes in error text can reveal backend tech (DB drivers, template engines) or flaw type.  
- **Unexpected 200 responses:** Some payloads may stop the error and return `200`, indicating a bypass or exploitation.  
- **Dramatic response length changes:** Strong signal your payload altered application behavior.

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Efficient Hunting

- **Filter Wisely:** Don't filter out 500 errors as noise â€” include them (`-mc all` or explicitly include `500`).  
- **Go Beyond GET:** Fuzz `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests â€” send payloads in the body.  
- **Context-aware payloads:** Use payload lists tailored for SQLi, Command Injection, Path Traversal, SSRF, etc. A parameter that errors on a basic integer may be vulnerable to SQLi.  
- **Automate triage:** Combine fuzzing with response-matching rules to reduce manual checks.

## âš¡ Putting It Together

Finding a 500 error is like discovering a signpost that says **"Poke Here."** Methodically discover parameters, then fuzz intelligently â€” transform a generic server error into a critical security finding.
