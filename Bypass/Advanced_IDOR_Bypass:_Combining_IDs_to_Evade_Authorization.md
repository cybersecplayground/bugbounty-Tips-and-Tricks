# 🔍 Advanced IDOR Bypass: Combining IDs to Evade Authorization

Sometimes a direct access attempt to another user’s data fails — but by cleverly **pairing your own ID** with the target's, you can bypass restrictions.

---

## 🧪 Real-World Scenario

- **Victim's User ID**: `5200`  
- **Attacker's User ID**: `5233` (authenticated)

### ❌ Normal Request – Forbidden
```http
GET /api/users/5200/info
Response: 403 Forbidden
```

✅ Bypassed Request – Combine IDs
```
GET /api/users/5200,5233/info
Response: 200 OK
```

🎯 Outcome: Both users' info is returned — because the attacker’s own ID is used to "legitimize" the request.

## 🧠 Why This Bypass Works
Improper Authorization Logic:
- The backend only checks if any of the requested IDs are authorized, not all.

Batch Processing Bugs:
- APIs that allow multiple IDs (comma-separated or arrays) often forget to validate each ID independently.

Lazy Filtering:
Some systems validate only the first or last ID, assuming the rest are similar or already verified.

## 🔐 Developer Defense Tips

✅ Validate Each ID Individually
- Always check that the authenticated user has access to every entity requested.
  
✅ Deny Mixed-ID Access
- Reject requests where one or more IDs are unauthorized, even if one is valid.
  
✅ Monitor for Suspicious Patterns
- Watch for comma-separated or array-based ID access attempts in logs:

```
/api/users/1234,5678/info
```

**📚 Takeaway**
This kind of subtle IDOR logic flaw is gold in bug bounties and red team assessments.

Keep testing those edges — when the door won’t open, try widening the keyhole.
