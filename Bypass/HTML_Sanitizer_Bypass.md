# 🚨 HTML Sanitizer Bypass → XSS in Cloudflare-Protected Sites

## 🔍 **Summary**

A clever bypass has been discovered that targets **HTML sanitizers**, even those protected by **Cloudflare**. The exploit uses malformed tags, encoded characters, and confusing DOM structure to execute **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** payloads — bypassing typical protections.

---

## 🧪 **Payload Example**

```
<00 foo="<a%20href="javascript:alert('XSS-Bypass')">XSS-Click</00>--%20/
```

💥 **Breakdown**
- `<00>` : Fake tag to confuse the sanitizer.

- `%20` : URL-encoded space to sneak through basic filters.

- `href="javascript:..."` : Executes JavaScript on click.

- `</00>` : Closes a fake tag — some parsers mishandle it and leave payloads untouched.

🧼 **What is an HTML Sanitizer?**
An HTML Sanitizer is a filter that protects against XSS by:

- Removing dangerous tags (e.g., <script>, <iframe>)
- Stripping JS event handlers (onerror, onclick)
- Escaping embedded scripts or unwanted links
- But attackers use evasive techniques to slip through...

🎭 Bypass Techniques

**1️⃣ Broken Tag Parsing**
- Injecting malformed or incomplete HTML tags to confuse the sanitizer.

**2️⃣ Double Encoding / Mixed Encoding**
- Using `%20 (space)`, `&#x` hex codes, or malformed entities to sneak past filters.

**3️⃣ Exotic HTML Elements**
- Tags like `<xmp>`, `<noscript>`, `<svg>`, `<math>`, etc., which behave differently across browsers.


**4️⃣ Unescaped Attributes**
- Exploiting open attributes or injecting unexpected quotes to break out of the context.

**🛡 Defense Tips**
- ✅ Use trusted libraries like DOMPurify with strict settings
- ✅ Remove invalid/custom tags completely
- ✅ Apply context-aware escaping (HTML, JS, URL)
- ✅ Sanitize AND validate all user input — never trust frontend-only checks

**📌 Real-World Insight**
Even platforms like Cloudflare, with strong protection layers, can be bypassed when filters misinterpret malformed or encoded HTML. Regular security audits and real-user testing are critical.
