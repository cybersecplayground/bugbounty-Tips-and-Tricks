# üîì Captcha Bypass Techniques

Many web applications implement CAPTCHAs to prevent automated abuse (logins, registrations, spam).  
However, CAPTCHAs are often misconfigured or weak, making them bypassable during penetration testing or bug bounty hunting.

## üîë Common Bypass Techniques

### 1. Reusing Captcha Tokens
Some apps don‚Äôt invalidate CAPTCHA after being solved once.  
‚û°Ô∏è You can replay the same token for multiple requests.

### 2. Weak Validation (Frontend-Only)
If CAPTCHA is only validated in JavaScript, sending direct requests to the backend bypasses it.

### 3. Predictable or Static Captchas
Math-based or static CAPTCHAs (e.g., `2+3=?`) are trivial to solve.  
‚û°Ô∏è Bots/scripts can solve automatically.

### 4. OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
Text-based CAPTCHAs can be solved with OCR tools like `tesseract-ocr`.

### 5. Third-Party CAPTCHA Misconfigurations
For services like Google reCAPTCHA:  
‚û°Ô∏è If the site doesn‚Äôt verify tokens with the API, any random token works.

### 6. Replay Attacks
CAPTCHA validation responses are sometimes valid for multiple requests.  
‚û°Ô∏è Capture once, reuse many times.

### 7. Alternate Endpoints
Some APIs or hidden endpoints skip CAPTCHA validation.  
‚û°Ô∏è Example: `/api/register` without CAPTCHA enforcement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Bug Bounty Testing Tips
- Always test token replayability  
- Inspect network requests ‚Üí check if backend validates  
- Use **Burp Suite Intruder** or Python scripts for automation  
- Look for alternate API endpoints that may skip CAPTCHA enforcement
