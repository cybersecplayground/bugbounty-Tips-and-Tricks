# üöÄ Bug Bounty Tip ‚Äì Bypass Rate Limits with Race Conditions & Header Tricks
![ratelimitattackpost](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e22967d4-2a11-435d-833f-37257b1e7594)

## 1) Race Condition Attack (Single-Endpoint Overrun)
Even strict brute-force protections can fail. By sending multiple requests almost at the same time, you can slip past rate limits:

- **HTTP/2 "single-packet" attack:** Use Turbo Intruder to send simultaneous login or OTP requests.
- **HTTP/1.1 ‚Äúlast-byte sync‚Äù:** Send most of each request, pause, then release final bytes together using Nagle‚Äôs algorithm to batch traffic.

This can allow brute forcing passwords or codes before counters update.

## 2) Classic Rate Limit Bypasses (Header & Parameter Manipulation ‚Äì HackTricks)
HackTricks outlines simple but powerful bypass tricks:

- **Use similar endpoints:**  
  Example: `/signup`, `/sign-up`, `/SignUp`, `/Sing-up`  
  Many implementations handle each variant separately.

- **Insert blank or encoded chars:**  
  Example: `code=1234%0a`, `%0d%0a`, `%00`, `%09`  
  Even tiny changes to the request param can evade naive repeat checks.

- **Change originating IP via headers:**  
  Tools like `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Originating-IP`, or duplicates thereof can trick the server into thinking each request is from a different IP.

- **Rotate headers like User-Agent, cookies, etc.:**  
  Some frameworks or CDNs may rate-limit based on request fingerprint.

- **Add trailing query parameters:**  
  Example: `/resetpwd?x=1` or `/resetpwd?x=1&y=2`  
  Some routing or WAF layers treat these as unique paths.

## Tips Summary Table

| Technique                       | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Race Condition (Turbo Intruder) | Send parallel requests to outrun rate counters |
| Endpoint Variance               | Slight URL tweaks to bypass endpoint protections |
| Encoded Payload Sanitization    | Use whitespace/encoding to break filter detection |
| Header Spoofing                 | Rotate IP headers (e.g., X-Forwarded-For) per request |
| Request Fingerprint Rotation    | Change User-Agent or add dummy cookies |
| Param Variation in URLs         | Append dummy query params to treat as unique paths |

## Real-Life Use Cases
- Brute-force login or OTP without triggering lockouts
- Flooding password reset forms or signup pages
- Testing vulnerability to logic flaws via race timing (e.g., double withdrawals, gift card reuse)

## Defense Recommendations
- **Global rate-limiter:** apply across IPs, sessions, and headers  
- **Normalize headers:** rely only on trusted proxies  
- **Canonical endpoint detection:** treat `/signup`, `/sign-up`, `/SignUp` as same resource  
- **Secure param validation:** strip encoded characters like `%0a` in sensitive parameters  
- **Monitor abnormal patterns:** detect concurrent traffic bursts or header anomalies

Stay sharp with header tricks and timing attacks ‚Äî they take you past simple protections.
