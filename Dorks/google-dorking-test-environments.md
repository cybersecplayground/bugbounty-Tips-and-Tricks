<img width="1200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/117853cf-6769-427b-a94e-a700a57431f7" />

## 🔥 The Dork That Exposes Everything
```
inurl:test | inurl:env | inurl:dev | inurl:staging | inurl:sandbox | inurl:debug | inurl:temp | inurl:internal | inurl:demo site:example[.]com
```

---

## 🎯 What You'll Find
- Test environments with weaker security  
- Development servers often containing debug data  
- Staging sites with real production data  
- Sandbox environments that might be misconfigured  
- Internal tools accidentally exposed to the internet

---

## 🛠 Pro Dork Combinations

**Find Configuration Files**
```
site:example.com ext:env | ext:config | ext:yml | ext:yaml
```

**Discover Backup Files**
```
site:example.com ext:bak | ext:backup | ext:old | ext:save
```

**Locate Admin Panels**
```
site:example.com inurl:admin | inurl:login | inurl:dashboard
```

**Find API Endpoints**
```
site:example.com inurl:api | inurl:rest | inurl:graphql
```

---

## 💡 Why This Works
- Developers often forget to block search engines from test environments  
- Test sites frequently have weaker authentication  
- Debug information might be enabled  
- Real credentials and data are often present

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Only test authorized targets  
- Report findings responsibly through proper channels  
- Don't exploit without permission  
- Many companies have bug bounty programs for these findings

---

## 🛡 Defense Tips for Companies
- **Robots.txt** — Properly block search engine indexing of non-production environments  
- **Authentication** — Require login for all internal/test environments  
- **Network Segmentation** — Keep test environments internal-only  
- **Monitoring** — Alert on unauthorized access attempts
