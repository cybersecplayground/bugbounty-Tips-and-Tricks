# 🚩 Beginner's Guide (Part 2 of File Upload Week): Exploiting ZIP Uploads for RCE

If a web application allows you to upload `.zip` files, this technique might lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE)!

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Exploitation

1. **Create a PHP payload** (e.g., `rce.php`)  
2. **Compress it**: `file.zip`  
3. Upload `file.zip` to the vulnerable web application  
4. Trigger the payload by accessing:

```
https://<target>.com/index.php?page=zip://path/file.zip#rce.php
```

> 💥 If the server dynamically includes ZIP content, your PHP code executes = RCE achieved!

## 🧠 Vulnerable Systems
This works on servers with poorly configured ZIP handlers (e.g., outdated CMS or custom file viewers).

## ✅ Pro Tip
Always analyze how the application processes uploaded files. If it dynamically includes content using user-controlled input, you might have an exploitable vulnerability.
