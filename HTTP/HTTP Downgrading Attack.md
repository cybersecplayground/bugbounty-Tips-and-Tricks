## 🚨 Bug Bounty Tip: HTTP Downgrading Attack! 🚨

### 🔍 What is HTTP Downgrading?
 > HTTP/2 is now the standard for most modern web applications, but many backend servers still use HTTP/1.1. This mismatch between frontend and backend can lead to parsing issues and open doors to certain attacks.

HTTP Downgrading is the process of forcing a request to be processed under HTTP/1.1 instead of HTTP/2. Why?

### ⚡️Why Use HTTP Downgrading?
- Exploit HTTP/1.1 parsing vulnerabilities, such as Content-Length Transfer-Encoding (CL.TE) attacks.
- This allows you to manipulate how the frontend and backend servers interpret requests, often bypassing security checks!

### 💡How Does It Work?

- 1️⃣ Open Burp Suite and go to Proxy → HTTP History.
- 2️⃣ Locate the request that is currently using HTTP/2.
- 3️⃣ Send it to Repeater.
- 4️⃣ In the Repeater tab, open the Inspector panel → Request Attributes → Protocol.
- 5️⃣ Change the HTTP version to HTTP/1.1.
- 6️⃣ Click “Send” in Repeater.

✅ If **successful**, you should get a valid response confirming that the backend server accepts HTTP/1.1!

⸻

💥 **Pro Tip**: Once the request is downgraded, try exploiting CL.TE vulnerabilities for advanced attacks like Response Splitting or Request Smuggling.
