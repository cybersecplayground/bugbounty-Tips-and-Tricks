# 🧠 HTTP Header Injection → Redirect Abuse & Response Splitting

Let’s break down a dangerous bug that’s still alive in many web apps 👇

## 🔍 Scenario:
An app reflects unsanitized input in HTTP response headers, such as:

`Location: https://example.com/welcome?user=$input`

## 🧨 Exploitation Steps:

**1️⃣ Attacker Input:**
`test\nSet-Cookie: admin=true`

**2️⃣ Server Response:**
```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://example.com/welcome?user=test
Set-Cookie: admin=true
```
## ✅ Result:
Attacker injects new headers (e.g., cookies), causing:

- 🟡 Cache poisoning  
- 🟡 Privilege escalation  
- 🟡 Authentication bypass  
- 🟡 Redirect to phishing pages  

---

## 🔥 Key Techniques:

- ✅ Use `\n` or `%0a` to break headers  
- ✅ Abuse `Location`, `Referer`, `Set-Cookie`, or custom headers  
- ✅ Combine with open redirects for phishing or SSO bypass  

---

## 💡 Defensive Tip:
Always validate and encode user input **before** inserting into HTTP headers!
