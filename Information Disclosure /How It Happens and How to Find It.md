### 🔸 Misconfigured Web Servers
- Example: Directory listing enabled without authentication, exposing critical files.

### 🔸 Hidden Form Fields Abuse
- Example: Changing hidden form values (`student ➔ admin`) to escalate privileges.

### 🔸 Exposed API Keys or Credentials
- Example: AWS keys or database credentials hardcoded in frontend JavaScript files.
