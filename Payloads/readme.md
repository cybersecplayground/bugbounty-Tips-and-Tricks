### üî• Ultimate Payload Arsenal
> This repository contains a comprehensive collection of payloads for various types of web application security testing, including but not limited to:

- üêö Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- üêû Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- üìÇ Directory Traversal
- üîì SQL Injection (SQLi)
- üß™ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- üîê Authentication Bypass
- üéØ Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

üß† **Advanced Bypass Techniques**

### üìÅ Structure
Each attack vector has its own directory or file with categorized payloads based on:

- Context (GET/POST/Headers)
- Encoding (URL encoded, double encoded, base64)
- Filter bypasses
- Real-world examples

‚úÖ **Usage**
Use these payloads during penetration tests, bug bounty hunting, and security research. Combine with tools like:

`Burp Suite` `FFUF` `wfuzz` `curl/httpie` `Custom automation scripts`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Use these payloads ethically and only on systems you have permission to test. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.
