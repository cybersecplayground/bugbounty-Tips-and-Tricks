# SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)

Welcome to the SSRF module of the Bug Bounty Tips & Tricks collection! This folder provides real-world SSRF techniques, proof-of-concept (PoC) code, detection strategies, and mitigation guidance tailored for practical penetration testing and responsible disclosure.

---

##  What's Inside

- **Payloads & PoCs** – Step-by-step examples and requests demonstrating common SSRF exploitation paths (e.g., cloud metadata, internal service access).
- **Bypass Techniques** – Advanced header manipulation, filter evasion, and development stack-specific attack patterns.
- **Detection Tips** – Methods to identify SSRF via logging, out-of-band (OOB) callbacks, and anomalous server requests.
- **Mitigation Strategies** – Best practices for prevention including allowlisting, robust URL validation, and hardened middleware logic.

##  How to Use This Folder

1. **Review the PoCs** to understand typical SSRF patterns.
2. **Adapt the payloads** against your target’s infrastructure and middleware.
3. **Log outbound interactions** using tools like Burp Collaborator or Interactsh.
4. **Implement recommended defenses** such as validating redirect targets or blocking internal IP ranges.

##  Pro Tip

SSRF bugs are often subtle, triggered by innovative endpoints or headers—keep experimenting with `X-Middleware-Rewrite`, `Host`, and unconventional query parameters. Combine this with OOB testing for maximum impact.

Contributions welcome! Feel free to submit new PoCs, bypass tricks, or defensive strategies via pull requests.
