# 🐞 Bug-Hunt Tips for New Hunters  
## 🎯 Discover Unauthenticated Panels by Fingerprint  

Looking to score easy wins in your bug bounty or recon workflow?  
Use this simple `whatweb` trick to find exposed admin panels that don’t require authentication:

```bash
whatweb -i live.txt | grep -i "admin\|dashboard\|login"
```
## 📌 What this does:
- Scans a list of live hosts (live.txt)
- Filters out pages that mention:
- admin panels
- dashboard UIs
- login portals

## 🔎 Why it works:
- Many platforms like:
- Jenkins
- Kibana
- Prometheus
- Webmin
- phpMyAdmin
...are often deployed and forgotten, especially in internal or staging environments.

## ➡️ No auth = jackpot for:
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Credential leaks
- Internal service exposure
- Lateral movement

## 🚨 Real-world tip:
- Once found, try:
- Default credentials (admin:admin, root:toor)
- Known CVEs (e.g., Jenkins RCE, unauth Kibana SSRF)
- Screenshotting with aquatone or gowitness for easy triage

**🧠 Pro tip:**
Chain this into your recon pipeline:

```
subfinder | httpx -status-code -silent > live.txt
whatweb -i live.txt | grep -i "admin\|dashboard\|login"
```
🎓 Knowledge = access.

Stay sharp, automate wisely, and always test legacy panels.
