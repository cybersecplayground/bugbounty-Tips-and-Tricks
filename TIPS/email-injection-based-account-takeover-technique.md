## 🔓 Account Takeover via Email Injection Tricks

Sometimes, you don’t need a full-blown vulnerability — just a poorly implemented input parser. This document covers a clever way to hijack user accounts through email injection.

### 🎯 The Attack Idea

If an application fails to validate email input properly and sends confirmation or reset links to multiple recipients, you may be able to inject your email and receive a copy of the security link.

### 🔍 Common Injection Payloads (Separators)

```text
email=victim@mail.com,hacker@mail.com
email=victim@mail.com%20hacker@mail.com
email=victim@mail.com|hacker@mail.com
```

### 📦 Array-Based Payload

Some APIs may accept arrays:

```json
{
  "email": ["victim@mail.com", "hacker@mail.com"]
}
```

### 🧠 Why This Works

* Backend libraries in languages like **PHP**, **Node.js**, and **Python** may parse input using loose rules.
* Improper validation or sanitization can lead to sending emails to all provided addresses.

### ✅ What to Test

* **User registration flows**
* **Password reset mechanisms**
* **Invite or referral systems**

### 🛠 Tooling Tips

* Use **Burp Suite** for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests
* **Param Miner** to fuzz parameter behaviors
* **HTTP Repeater** to check server behavior with payload variations

### 🔐 Prevention

* Enforce strict email validation using regex and server-side filters
* Avoid parsing arrays or splitting strings from input unless intended
* Send emails only to verified addresses after validation
