Tired of hunting manually? Let automation do the heavy lifting. 🚀  
Here’s a quick workflow to find XSS, SQLi, SSRF, Open Redirects and more with just a few commands:

---

## 🛠 Steps

### 1️⃣ Google Dorking for PHP endpoints
```bash
site:*.company.com ext:php
```

### 2️⃣ Collect URLs + Parameters
```bash
echo https://company.com | gau | grep "?" | uro | httpx -silent > parameters.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run Automated Fuzzing
```bash
nuclei -l parameters.txt -t fuzzing-templates
```

Nuclei offers robust support for fuzzing, which involves injecting unexpected or malformed data into various parts of an HTTP request to identify potential vulnerabilities. Nuclei templates are used to define these fuzzing scenarios.

#### ⚡️ Key aspects of Nuclei fuzzing templates:
- **Comprehensive Fuzzing Support:**  
  Nuclei allows fuzzing in various components of an HTTP request, including:
  - **Headers:** Manipulating request headers.
  - **Cookies:** Injecting payloads into cookie values.
  - **Paths:** Fuzzing URL paths and parameters.
  - **Bodies:** Supporting fuzzing for different body formats like JSON, XML, Form data, and Multipart/Form-Data.
  - **Query Parameters:** Fuzzing values within the URL query string.

### 4️⃣ Profit 💰
✔️ Nuclei reports possible XSS, SQLi, SSRF, Open Redirects, and more!

## 🔥 Why This Works
- `gau` (GetAllURLs) → gathers archived endpoints  
- `uro` → removes duplicates  
- `httpx` → checks live hosts  
- `nuclei` → scans for vulnerabilities using community templates
