# 🔍 Triple Fuzzing Technique for Hidden Paths

Discovered a suspicious-looking URL during recon?

Example:
```
https://test[.]com:8443/phpmyadmin
```

Don’t stop there — **Triple Fuzz it**! 🧠

---

## 🔥 Try Fuzzing These Paths:

1️⃣ `https://test[.]com/FUZZ`  
2️⃣ `https://test[.]com:8443/FUZZ`  
3️⃣ `https://test[.]com:8443/phpmyadmin/FUZZ`

---

## ✅ Why It Works:

- **Different ports** may expose **different services**
- **Nested directories** often hide backups or restricted panels
- **Misconfigured virtual paths** can leak sensitive endpoints
